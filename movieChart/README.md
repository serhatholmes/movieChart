# Project Name

Movies and Series

In this project, movie information taken from the Omdb library is listed and displayed. The project includes features such as searching by movie name and movie release year.
Additionally, when each page is advanced, only a new query is created, thus ensuring a more optimized project.

# Info

React js, vite, typescript, pure css(I could have used other css libraries, but since I haven't used pure css for a long time, I wanted to test it myself.), rtk toolkit and router were used in the project.
